                <h1>Types of Technical Documentation</h1>
                <p>All types of technical documentation fall into three main categories: product documentation, process documentation, and
                sales and marketing documents.</p>

                <h2>Product Documentation</h2>
                <p>Product documentation encompasses in-depth guides, training manuals, and information that show users how a product
                should work or how to use a product.</p>
                <p>When most people say “technical documentation,” they are talking about product documentation. Product documents
                typically cover instructions and tutorials to help end-users accomplish a task. <code>They include guides, illustrations, and
                reference sheets that cover:</code></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information on the requirements or system specifications users need to run the product efficiently</li>
                    <li>Installation and usage instructions</li>
                    <li>Frequently asked questions (FAQs) or knowledge base</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For product documentation, it’s recommended to leverage technical writing software and software documentation tools to
                create easy-to-use and help documentation.</p>

                <h2>Process Documentation</h2>
                <p>Process documentation, on the other hand, is a document that shows an internal team what they need to know to properly
                execute a task. It covers information that helps <code>consistency and accountability within your organization,</code>
                including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plans, schedules, and notes that establish standards and patterns for different processes</li>

            <p>Sales and marketing documentation presents information to help your organization establish its niche in the market and
            provides sales enablement content to win more customers. A few technical writing examples of these types of documents
            include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market requirement and business plan documents that helps set the groundwork for a company</li>
                <li>White papers and case studies to show potential customers the real-life application of your product or service.</li>
                <li>RFPs and proposals that help attract and secure business partners and new contracts.</li>

                <h2>Product Manuals</h2>
                <p>A product manual explains the parts of a product, where you can find each part, and what each part is used for. It
                essentially details everything a user needs to know about how a product functions.</p>
                <p>Although product manuals are most common with physical products — most of them contain product part diagrams and
                illustrations — they can be created for any kind of product.</p>
                <p>Here’s a <code>page from the product manual of networking solution provider Cisco</code></p>
                <p>There are three basic steps needed to create most product manuals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decide what the manual is going to cover.</li>
                    <li>Create appropriate illustrations for the sections that need them.</li>
                    <li>Write clear explanations of each step in the process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may decide to create and deliver your product manual as an interactive experience that combines UI patterns like
                walkthroughs, pop-ups, explainer videos, and beacons to encourage learning in the flow of work.</p>

                <h2>Repair Manuals</h2>
                <p>Repair manuals are technical documents that explain the correct way to fix a damaged product. Customers need them to
                navigate hardware problems or a combination of issues.</p>
                <p>When people deal with these kinds of situations, it’s helpful to have clear, concise information available that helps
                them through repairs quickly and efficiently, so they can get back to the work they love.<code> To create an efficient repair
                manual,</code> you need to anticipate every kind of product damage customers may face, then explain how to navigate it.</p>

            <h2>API Documentation</h2>
            <p>API documentation explains how developers can integrate other products with your product using an API (application
            programming interface).</p>
            <p>To create useful <code>API documentation,</code> consider the business value (i.e., what benefits will clients get when they use your
            product) as well as the technical requirements (i.e., how the client needs to be able to consume your API in order for
            it to function properly). You’ll need to include the functions, classes, arguments, and return types of your API in your
            API doc.</p>
